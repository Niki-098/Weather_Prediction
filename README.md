This is the weather prediction project which I have build using naive_bayes(Gaussian) model.I have used google colaboratory which is way more convenient to work upon.

The steps for model building are -

* Step1 - Import the libraries to be used in it.
* Step2 - Import the dataset(have used kaggle dataset).
* Step3 - Taking care of missing data.
* Step4 - Splitting the dataset into the training set and test set(80:20)
* Step5 - Training the naive bayes model on the training set
* Step6 - Model evaluation, checking accuracy on training data
* Step7 - Predicting the test set results
* Step8 - Checking accuracy on test set
